User Identification
===================

One of the key advantages of online recording solutions over traditional means of
submitting records is that is allows recorders to keep direct control over their records.
They can view the "top copy" of their records, check the verification status and make
amendments all in real time. These functions all share the prerequisite that not only do
we store the name of the recorder with the record, but we maintain a link from the record
to the recorder's login, so that the records are not confused with other people having the
same name. In Indicia based online recording, the mechanism by which this link is
maintained is not set in stone, unlike most other recording systems, in fact it may not
exist at all. This is because the toolkit supports many different types of recording - in
some cases it may be appropriate to expect a user to login, but not in others for example.
The following sections describe each of the more common scenarios supported by Indicia.

Anonymous recording
-------------------

In this scenario, no personal details are associated with each record. Generally, a record
without the "who" part does not fulfil the minimum requirements of what most people define
as the essentials of a biological record: who, what, where and when. However, Indicia is
ideal for building surveys which are intended to encourage participation in biological
recording at all levels and in some cases not capturing recorder information may be
considered appropriate. An example might be a survey designed to inspire school children.
In this scenario, records cannot be linked back to the original recorder, which limits 
their use outside the survey. It also means that feedback such as reports, charts or maps
of "my records" cannot be generated.

Recorder name attributes
------------------------

To complete the basic details of a biological record, custom attributes can be added to a
survey to capture the recorder's first name and surname (or just full name) as well as 
other personal details such as email or address. This approach is useful when you want to
capture records without expecting the user to sign up for a website, but like the 
anonymous approach above this also means that feedback such as reports, charts or maps
of "my records" cannot be generated, because a recorder name by itself does not uniquely
identify the recorder.

Link to content management system user ID
-----------------------------------------

If you are able to expect your recorders to log in to the website before contributing
records, then the recorder's user ID (as provided by the host website) can be stored with
each record, thus associating the record with the user. This has several benefits:

* Recorders do not need to input their name with each record, they can do this once on 
  registration.
* Generation of reports of the user's own records becomes simple.
* Recorders can maintain a list of their own records and return to records to make 
  corrections or add extra information to notable records. 
* Information about the recorder's preferred recording habits (such as place and taxonomic
  groups) can be kept with their user account and used to optimise the system for them.
* Users can be associated with the sites they record at (e.g. for surveillance projects).

Additionally, requiring a logon provides additional possibilities relating to website 
management and spam prevention. The disadvantage of this approach is the user account 
details are stored in the Drupal website's database, which is *a different database to
Indicia's warehouse*. Therefore reporting on records with the recorder's name is not
trivial. To mitigate this, if you add Email, First Name and Last Name attributes to the 
survey's custom attributes, then the attributes will be hidden and populated with the 
appropriate details from the user's account by default, thus storing the recorder's 
information with the record in the warehouse database.

.. tip::

  To ensure that the code knows you are using a custom attribute to store the recorder's
  content first name, surname and email address, you must set the **System Function** 
  of each custom attribute correctly on the warehouse's attribute edit screen.

Easy Login
----------

Instant Indicia provides an optional feature called Easy Login which links any user 
accounts created on your Drupal website with a user account on the Indicia warehouse. The
user's email is used to uniquely identify users, which means that if someone registers on 
several websites that share the same warehouse, there will only be one user account 
created on the warehouse. This means that each user is uniquely identifiable across the 
warehouse. This approach has the following benefits over storing a content management 
system user ID:

* It becomes possible to report on a user's records across multiple client websites.
* Less configuration required for each survey as no custom attributes are required to 
  store the link to the user.
* User's preferences *could* be shared across multiple websites (though data protection 
  issues must be considered). 
  
So, consider the scenario where a user of iRecord (which allows recording of wildlife 
across the UK) contributes records to the BWARS tree bee survey - Easy Login means that 
the recorder can see their BWARS records in the My Records section of iRecord. They can 
keep all their records in one place even if they have used multiple websites to contribute
the records.
