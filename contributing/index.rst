Indicia is the only toolkit designed from the ground up to make the task of
building biological recording websites simpler. It is also both free and open
source. This means that every improvement made to Indicia, from the tiniest of
bug fixes through to large developments of new functionality, are made available
to the biological recording community at no extra cost.

   Don't forget, contributing to Indicia's development is a really great way to
