Web Services Code Illustration
==============================

The following code provides a thoroughly commented standalone demonstration of how to use
the Indicia web services to read and write data, with no dependencies on the Client 
Helpers API. As such it is useful for anyone wanting to avoid the overhead of the Client
Helpers API or wishing to port the code to other development languages.

  /**
   * This PHP file is designed to provide a basic illustration of the code required to read
   * information from and write to the Indicia web services without using the Client Helpers
   * API. It could be used as the basis of a port to other languages, or for as the starting
   * point for PHP developments using Indicia where you don't want the overhead of the entire
   * Client Helpers API.
   * 
   * The file is in 2 parts. At the top there is example code which demonstrates reading a
   * record from the database, writing a wildlife record back to the database and also 
   * accessing data via a report. This code is dependent on a small class provided in the 
   * second half of the file which exposes public functions used to interact with the Indicia
   * web services. You can copy this class into your own developments if needs be, though 
   * note that it contains hard coded references to the BRC test warehouse which would need
   * to be changed for any real usage.

  /*
   * Before we can actually post a record, we need to know the ID of the species we want to record. You might either
   * use a lookup control on your form which itself integrates with the data services, or you could have a static
   * list of species in something like an HTML <select> control, in which case you can use a fixed list of IDs.
   * In our case we'll use a web-services call to ask Indicia for the ID of a particular species first. The species
   * data available in the warehouse are organised into a number of lists; we will use list ID 34 which contains a 
   * partial import of the UKSI complete list. As this is a partial list copy, not all the species names you might
   * want to look up will be present - this is just a test scenario though. 
   */
  $species = $indiciaWs->getData(array(
    'table' => 'cache_taxa_taxon_list',
    'params' => array(
      'taxon_list_id' => 34,

    )

  /*
  We are now going to post a very simple submission to the web services. This will be a sample containing a single 
  occurrence record. Typically, the array you are sending to the postSubmission method here might come directly
  from a web form's $_POST data, though you need to ensure that you are mapping to the correct field names for it
  to work. 

  Information that is posted into the sample table refers to the event in which the sightings were observed, in other 
  words it describes the place, date, people, environmental conditions etc. Within a sample, you can post zero or 
  more occurrences which refer to each species sighted as part of the sample.

  When posting a sample, you must prefix the field name with 'sample:' in your array of field/value pairs. Some of the
  fields you can post for a sample are:
  sample:id - Set to an ID of an existing sample if updating. For a new sample, omit this from the array.
  sample:survey_id - Mandatory. This is the ID of the survey dataset you are posting into on the warehouse. In 
  our case we are using survey 1 on the testwarehouse. See http://indicia-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site-building/warehouse/surveys.html?highlight=survey
  for more info.
  sample:entered_sref - Mandatory. A formatted British National Grid reference, Irish Grid reference, or decimal lat 
  long (WGS84) such as 52.4N, 1.4E.
  sample:entered_sref_system - Mandatory. Either OSGB for British National Grid, OSIE for Irish Grid or 4326 for 
  decimal lat long. Note that 4326 is the official EPSG code for the WGS84 lat long projection.
  sample:date - Mandatory. Either ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd) or dd/mm/yyyy.
  sample:location_name - Optional. A free text name of the site.
  sample:comment - Optional. A free text comment.

  Your form array can also contain occurrences. Since you can store multiple occurrences in the flattened form array, 
  the structure for an occurrence field name in your array must be occurrence:uniqueId:fieldname. It doesn't matter
  what you use for the uniqueId but it must be the same for all the fields in the same occurrence record. You might,
  for example, use 1 for the first and 2 for the second occurrence etc. Some of the fields you can post for an occurrence
  are:
  occurrence:uniqueID:id
  occurrence:uniqueID:taxa_taxon_list_id
  occurrence:uniqueID:comment
  occurrence:uniqueID:training
  occurrence:uniqueID:zero_abundance
  occurrence:uniqueID:sensitivity_precision

  As well as these "core" fields, you can add custom attributes to your survey dataset, at either the sample level
  or the record level. For example you might create a custom attribute to store a habitat field value against
  each sample, or an abundance against each record. More information at:
  http://indicia-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site-building/warehouse/custom-attributes.html?highlight=custom%20attributes
  http://indicia-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/site-building/instant-indicia/example-setups/irecord-walkthrough/custom-attributes.html
  Once you have set up your custom attributes, you will know the ID allocated to each attribute in the warehouse. 
  You can then add a sample custom attribute value to your submission by sending a value for smpAttr:attrId, replacing the
  attrId with your attribute's ID. You can also submit an occurrence custom attribute value by submitting a field
  called occAttr:uniqueId:attrId, replacing uniqueId with the unique ID for your occurrence as described above and
  replacing the attrId with your attribute's ID on the warehouse.

  A final note about custom attributes - if you are resubmitting a record to update it then you will need to know the
  ID of any existing custom attribute value records (e.g. the ID of the record in sample_attribute_values or
  occurrence_attribute_values). Just to be clear - a sample custom attribute has a records in the sample_attributes table
  which describe metadata about each attribute, for example the caption, data type and validation rules for the
  attribute. Then when you save a record which includes a value for that custom attribute, a record is created in the
  sample_attribute_values table which describes the actual value being stored. Therefore this database record has an attribute
  value ID to uniquely identify it, represented by attrValId in the following fieldname construct:
  smpAttr:attrId:attrValId
  */

  /*
   * Our first post example posts a new record, consisting of a sample containing 1 occurrence. We use the 
   * Weather sample custom attribute (ID 1) to store a weather value and the Abundance occurrence custom
   * attribute (ID 145) to store an abundance value.
