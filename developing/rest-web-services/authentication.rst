RESTful web service authentication
==================================

Indicia's web services provide support for a variety of different types of clients,
including:

  * Standard websites with online recording and reporting facilities.
  * Mobile applications.
  * Other databases which synchronise data with the Indicia instance.
  * Developers working on site building or report writing.

In order to meet the needs of the different types of client, there are several
options for approaches to authentication.

  * A website might wish to authenticate as the registered website on the warehouse
    and will therefore gain access to all records contributed via that website or
    shared with the website for reporting purposes.
  * A mobile application user might authenticate as that specific user/application
    combination to gain access to just their records.
  * A remote database which synchronises with the warehouse needs to identify
    itself in order for the warehouse to ensure the correct filtered set of
    records is made available to it.
  * A developer will want to be able to simulate all these options without the
    authentication process hindering the simplicity of development.

Given the above requirements, Indicia provides 3 options for identifying the
client making a web-service request:

#. The warehouse has a list of website registrations in the websites table. This
   describes each of the online recording websites that contribute records to
   the warehouse. Authentication of web service requests can be achieved by
   providing a website_id and using the website's password as the secret for
   authentication. This gives the client access to the records belonging to the
   given website registration as well as any which are shared with the website
   via warehouse configuration.
#. The warehouse also has a list of user accounts which can be used for
   authentication. Authentication of web service requests can be achieved by
   providing a user_id and website_id and using the user's warehouse password as
   the secret for authentication. This gives the client access to the user's
   records which they've contributed to the website identified by the given
   website_id. The user must of course be a member of the website. Optionally,
   provide a filter_id for a filter linked to the user which has
   defines_permissions=t (e.g. a filter granting verification rights) to give
   the client access to the filtered set of records.
#. Configure the warehouse REST API with a list of client systems that have
   access to records on the warehouse for synchronisation purposes. Provide the
   client system ID and use the configured secret for authentication to gain
   access to a set of records defined by a filter given in the configuration.

Support will be added in a future release.

HMAC
----

This approach to authentication relies on the client process using a shared
secret to build a hash value using the URL plus all the data values supplied in
the request. The hash (HMAC, or keyed-hash message authentication code) is
provided with the request but not the secret. The server side can then hash the
request's data with the secret (which it also knows) to generate the HMAC. If
they match then the request is authentic.

In more detail:

#. The requesting entity creates a HMAC-SHA1 value of the complete request url
   (including parameters). The hash value uses the user password as the shared secret.
#. The requesting entity adds an Authorization header to the request containing the
   following string [user type]:[user identifier]:HMAC:[hmac] where:

     * [user_type] is a token which identifies whether a registered website
       (WEBSITE_ID), warehouse user account (USER_ID) or client system defined
       in the REST API's configuration file (USER).
     * [user identifier] is the requesting client's identifier, either the website_id,
       user_id or client system ID as described above.
     * [hmac] is the HMAC-SHA1 value computed in (1)

#. The receiving entity recomputes the HMAC-SHA1 in the same manner as (1) and any
   authorisation failure is returned as HTTP 401 Unauthorized.

This authentication should provide suitable protection against tampering and sufficient
level of authentication providing the shared secret is sufficiently long.

The following example PHP snippet illustrates the code required for authentication against
the REST API as a client system described in the REST API's configuration file:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
  $shared_secret = 'mypassword';
  $userId = 'ME';
  $url = 'http://www.example.com/rest/projects';
  $session = curl_init();
  // Set the POST options.
  curl_setopt ($session, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
  curl_setopt($session, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);
  curl_setopt($session, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
  // Create the authentication HMAC
  $hmac = hash_hmac("sha1", $url, $shared_secret, $raw_output=FALSE);
  curl_setopt($session,
      CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER,
      array("Authorization: USER:$userId:HMAC:$hmac")
  );
  // Do the request
  $response = curl_exec($session);
  $httpCode = curl_getinfo($session, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
  $curlErrno = curl_errno($session);
  // Check for an error, or check if the http response was not OK.
  if ($curlErrno || $httpCode != 200) {
    echo "Error occurred accessing $url<br/>";
    echo "Rest API Sync error $httpCode<br/>";
    if ($curlErrno) {
      echo 'Error number: '.$curlErrno;
      echo 'Error message: '.curl_error($session);
    }
    throw new exception('Request to server failed');
  }
  $data = json_decode($response, true);
  ?>

Direct authentication
---------------------

HMAC authentication never require's the user's secret or password to be passed
across the connection between the client and server so is inherently secure and
it does not require a secure connection (https) to ensure the authentication
details cannot be sniffed. When a secure connection is available over https, or
when developing code so security is not a concern, it can be simpler to pass
a password to the authentication process directly without calculating an HMAC.
Note that the default configuration of a warehouse is to disallow directly
passing a password or secret to the REST API authentication so this needs to be
changed in the REST API's configuration where appropriate. See
:doc:`../../administrating/warehouse/modules/rest-api` for more information.
