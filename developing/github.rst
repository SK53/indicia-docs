GitHub and version control
**************************

Why use version control?
========================

Indicia's code is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/Indicia-Team/>`_. For a quick
primer, read this article explaining what GitHub is on `How-to-Geek 
<http://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/>`_.

This website provides a repository containing every code file being worked on. 

There are several popular version control systems in use for open source projects; Indicia
uses one called `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ because it is now the most widely used in
the open source community. When using a version control system, rather than edit the files
directly on the shared repository, developers make a local copy of all the code files and
work on them there. When happy that the change they are implementing is ready, they push
the changes back up to the server copy and other developers then merge those changes back
into their copies of the code. Git includes tools for viewing the differences between
files, resolving any conflicts that may occur and rolling back any changes subsequently
deemed to be unwanted. Git also allows you to *tag* versions of the code at a point in
time (tags are normally used to store a copy of the released versions of the code) and to
*branch* the code giving a parallel set of code to work on. Branches can be useful for
several reasons, one of which is to create an environment in which you can safely
experiment with the code without affecting the master copy until you are satisfied that
the experiment has succeeded. If it fails, just delete the branch! Branches are also used
to keep the current stable version of the code separate from the 'bleeding edge' code that
developers are currently working on.

Without a source control system such as Git, working as a collaborative team 
would be a quagmire of accidental overwrites of each other's changes, 
untraceable mistakes and other such nightmares.

Key Points
==========

  * Indicia’s code is hosted on GitHub, under the Indicia-Team organisation, 
    https://github.com/Indicia-Team.
  * The project is divided into repositories for the warehouse, client libraries, plus 
    Drupal version specific themes and modules. For example the Drupal 7 Indicia forms 
    module repository is at https://github.com/Indicia-Team/drupal-7-module-iform. 
  * Our Git workflow is based on the model proposed at 
    http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model.
  * All repositories have a history of changes to the code, and the current state of the 
    code exists in several “branches” - at least a master and a develop branch. The master 
    branch should always reflect the stable production ready code. The develop branch 
    contains development changes to the code which may not be production ready. Other 
    branches may exist either as a result of the migration from Google code or for current
    development needs.
    
Glossary
========

For a full glossary of Git terms, see https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary. 
The list below covers some of the key ones we'll be using for Indicia code management.

  * Branch - a parallel version of the code in a repository, for example there can be a
    stable branch, a branch for the bleeding edge development code, plus branches for 
    specific features under development.
  * Clone - copy a repository to a different location, for example to copy the warehouse
    code from GitHub to a local development environment. Because Git is a distributed 
    version control system as opposed to a centralised one, each clone is a full copy
    of the repository and you can commit changes to it, work on it offline etc. Clones
    remain synced with the repository they were copied from and can be easily synced.
  * Checkout - 
  * Commit - an individual change to a file or a set of files which create a new revision
    of those files. 
  * Fork - to copy a repository to a different GitHub account. The fork can then be worked
    on independently or a pull request issues later to ask for changes to be merged back
    in.
  * Merge - to take the changes from one branch and merge them into another.
  * Origin - an alias for the URL of the repository on GitHub which contains the accepted
    master copy of the code. 
  * Pull - fetching changes to a file from the remote version of that file into your 
    local copy and merging them.
  * Pull request - a proposal that changes submitted to a repository are to be accepted
    into the repository. In Git, a developer without commit rights can fork a repository
    and work on their own, then issue a pull request to ask for their changes to be
    accepted.
  * Push - to send locally committed changes from a local repository to a remote 
    repository.
  * Tag - to mark a point in the history of a repository as significant, for example to 
    mark the point at which a release was made. 

I'm not an Indicia contributor and I want to ...
================================================

...get the latest stable code from a repository
-----------------------------------------------

  #. Follow the link for the repository you need the code for from the main `Indicia-Team 
     github page <https://github.com/Indicia-Team/>`_.
  #. Use the **Download ZIP** button on the right of the page.

...get the latest development code from a repository
----------------------------------------------------

  #. Follow the link for the repository you need the code for from the main `Indicia-Team 
     github page <https://github.com/Indicia-Team/>`_.
  #. Click on the **Branch: master** drop down button and select **develop** from the menu
     that appears.
  #. Use the **Download ZIP** button on the right of the page.

...clone a repository to your local machine
-------------------------------------------

Using your command line client, navigate to the folder you want the code copied to. In 
this case, the modules folder of our Drupal install.:: 

  cd sites/all/modules

Clone the repository to your local machine, remembering to specify the folder name you 
want the repository to clone into. You can get the Clone URL from the repository home page
on GitHub (https://github.com/Indicia-Team/drupal-7-module-iform_mobile_auth).::

  git clone https://github.com/Indicia-Team/drupal-7-module-iform_mobile_auth.git iform_mobile_auth

That’s got you a copy of the code. You’ll be pointing to the default branch (master – the 
stable code). You can check this by typing::

  git branch

That’s shown you just the branches you’ve got locally – only one so far. Type the 
following to check the available remote branches::

  git branch –r
  
If you want to switch to the bleeding edge develop version of the code::

  git fetch
  git checkout develop
  
Now, just toggle between master or develop by typing::

  git branch master

Or::

  git branch develop

============================================

...hotfix some live code 
------------------------

Sometimes it is necessary to release a change to the live master version of the code in a
repository without waiting for the next time the develop code branch is released to live.
This is called a hotfix since it bypasses the normal develop branch then release cycle.
Here are the steps required:

Create a branch called hotfix-* off of the master branch of the relevant repository::

  git checkout -b hotfix-myfix master
  
Make your required code changes in this branch, test and commit them.

If your repository has a version number file (e.g. `application/config/version.php` then
bump the version number and commit it. 

.. todo::

  What happens if the application version and database version are then out of step on the
  warehouse?

Publish/push your hotfix branch to the GitHub repo::

  git push origin hotfix-myfix

Login to GitHub and find the repository you are working on. Switch to your hotfix branch
then click the Pull request button. Make sure that the base is set to master and follow
the steps to create the pull request, check the changes then merge it.

Repeat the last step to merge the hotfix into the develop branch as well.

In GitHub, add a release to tag the new version number against the code.

.. tip::

  Merging into the develop branch might not work without many conflicts, due to the legacy
  of migration from Google Code. This issue should disappear once we start doing full 
  releases from the GitHub code. If that is the case, then you can simply repeat the 
  bugfix commit and version bump into the develop branch.

...develop a new feature
------------------------

New features are developed by creating a branch from the develop branch. The branch name 
should describe the feature and can be anything that does not clash with one of the other 
branch naming conventions, i.e. not master, develop, hotfix-* or release-*. Feature 
branches can be kept locally or pushed to remote (GitHub), which can be useful especially
when several developers are working on the feature. 

For example::

  git checkout -b my-new-feature develop
  
Then implement the feature and commit each atomic change as you proceed. When finished and
tested, publish/push the feature branch to the GitHub repo::

  git push origin my-new-feature
  
Login to GitHub and find the repository you are working on. Switch to your feature branch
then click the Pull request button. Make sure that the base is set to develop and follow
the steps to create the pull request, check the changes then merge it.
