Warehouse Extension Modules
===========================

The warehouse is designed as a lightweight core essential for all biological recording
usages of Indicia, with a set of optional extension modules that each enable a specific
area of functionality.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Modules can be installed on warehouses by editing the
application/config/config.php file using a text editor, then finding the definition of the
$config['modules'] array. Ensure that this contains the following line, replacing
module_name with the name of the file system folder which contains the module:

.. code-block:: php

  <?php
  ...
  MODPATH.'module_name',
  ...
  ?>

In some cases, the modules install additional menu items or tabs into the Indicia
warehouse user interface. Because the warehouse's user interface is cached for performance
reasons, when you install such a module you will need to remove the files from the
``application/cache`` folder in the warehouse installation folder which follow either of
the following patterns otherwise the user interface updates will not take place until
after the next cache update:

* tabs-*
* indicia-menu-*
